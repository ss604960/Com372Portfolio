<div id="aboutme">


I'm Sara, I'm a sophomore at Saint Joseph's University. 
I'm a communications major, with a minor in art.
My hobbies consist of volleyball, painting, photography, etc.... 
I graduated from Archmere Academy in 2013, where I participated in 
several sports teams and developed an AP drawing/painting portfolio.
I'm big on being social, and I've had a few small jobs that require
working well with others consistantly.
