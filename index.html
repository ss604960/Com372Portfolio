	<h2>Hello World!</h2>I'm Sara, I'm a sophomore at Saint 
	Joseph's University. I'm a communications major, with a minor 
	in art. My hobbies consist of volleyball, painting, and photography. 
	Painting has always been a big part of my life, which is why I created
	my blog based around that. You'll find the images of paintings on my blog as well 
	those on this page are all of my own work. 
	   <i>- Thanks ! </i>
